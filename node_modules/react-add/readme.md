# React add
## 👷 A work in progress !

🔥 Motivation: 
As React ecosystem does not have a CLI for creating components (like Angular), creating and configuring manual components might take more time than expected. This package aims for simplicty and uses familiar terms to configure a component and get started quickly.

### Features 🚀

  - ✔️ Class component 
  - ✔️ Function component
  - ✔️ Redux addition to class components
  - ✔️ LESS, SCSS, CSS choose for either of class or function components
  - ✔️ Stores components into a json file and can be reused by other person

In next releases:
  - Add react router (import, and withRouter hoc)
  - Save a component preset and use it when needed
  - More customization added

### Installation

'React add' can be use as a global package, using npm

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
$ npm install -g react-add
$ react-add --version (If everything was correct should output the version number)
```


React-add needs to be initialized first
```sh
$ react-add init
```

And then can be used like this

For class components:
```sh
$ react-add rcc
```

For function components:
```sh
$ react-add rfc
```

If you recived a reactadd.json file, you can install it using:
```sh
$ react-add install
```
